### OOP (OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING)
- everything in python is an object 
- an object is a standalone entity that has its own properties
  (variables) and methods I(function implemented to the variables)
### Building blocks 0f OOP 
1. Classes or Class  :: is the blueprint for creating an object
2. object:: an instance or creation of a class

### PILLARS OF 
1. Inheritance :: allows ud to define a class snd inherit
all the methods and properties in another class
2. Encapsulation :: bundling of data and methods into one unit (class)
- protects data from direct access or modification outside the class
- Achieved by access modifiers 
  a. public :: accessible everywhere 
**b. _protected : hint that it should not be accessed directly**
- c. __private : Name-mangled to prevent
3. Abstraction: hiding complex implementation details and exposing 
only relevant ones 
- achieved using 
4. Polymorphism : Allows different classes to have methods with the same 
name but different implementations :
